# About the project

The File Creation Management Tool in Bash or just FCM-tool is a simple tool made in Shell Script (for linux) that can help you create several files in any folder and with the possibility of having several different extensions or sharing the same .

# How to use

To use this tool, you just need to run the FCM-tool on your terminal (with bash) and give a name to the directory it needs to be executed in (toggle it like any other terminal command or type it after running) and ask the question about the program files.

# How it Works

I will only know when this is over.
